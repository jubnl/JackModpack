# Jack's [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) Modpack

### Disclaimer

1. I did not make any of the mods within the modpack. I only made a simple way to install all those mode for you to enjoy. You'll find [below](#mod-list) all the devs that created the different mods.
2. This modpack is unstable as Balatro's modding only started few weeks ago.
3. If the Modpack is really unplayable, please open an issue or contact me directly on discord (@jackowheel), I'll adjust the mods.

## Installation

You'll need git ([Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)) installed on your machine to install the modpack.

1. Clone the repository with the following command in a CMD prompt (for Windows) or a bash/any shell for linux
```shell
# with ssh
git clone git@github.com:jubnl/Jacks-Balatro-Modpack.git --recurse-submodules Mods

# with https
git clone https://github.com/jubnl/Jacks-Balatro-Modpack.git --recurse-submodules Mods
```

2. Execute the setup script
```shell
cd Mods

# Windows
setup-windows.bat

# Linux
./setup-linux.sh
```

3. Copy the Mods folder to the right place
```shell
cd ..

# Windows
xcopy ".\Mods" "%appdata%\Balatro\Mods" /E /H /C /I

# Linux
cp -r ./Mods /home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2379780/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Balatro
```

4. Add a file to your Balatro installation
Find the latest release of the [Lovely-Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector/releases) and download
the file called `dwmapi.dll`. Once downloaded, put this file in the same folder as Balatro.exe.\
To find where the executable is stored you can click here:
![BrowseLocalFile.png](./screenshots/BrowseLocalFiles.png)
Your folder should now look like this:
![fs.png](./screenshots/fs.png)

5. You can now launch Balatro ! Enjoy !


## Disable a mod
To disable a mod, go to the copied Mods folder and delete the corresponding mod folder at the root of the Mods folder.
